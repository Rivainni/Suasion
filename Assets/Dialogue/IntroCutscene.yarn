NARRATOR: Some time ago, in a town called Hinterland. There lived a kid named Amsel and their friend, Sate.
NARRATOR: They spend their days, lounging and playing around the small town. The carelessness of childhood drowns their judgement. Blinds them to the horrors that reside under the dirt.
NARRATOR: Today, the children start their day by playing a game.
