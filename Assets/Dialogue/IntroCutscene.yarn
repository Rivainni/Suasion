NARRATOR: Some time ago, in a town called Suadere Hinterland. There lived a kid named Amsel and their friend, Sate.
NARRATOR: They spend their days, lounging and playing around the small town. The carelenssness of childhood, drowns their judgement. Blind to the horrors that reside under the dirt.
NARRATOR: Today, the children are starting their day by playing a game.
