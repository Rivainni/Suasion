Some time ago, in a town called Hinterland. There lived a kid named Amsel and their friend, Sate.
They spend their days, lounging and playing around the small town.
The carelessness of childhood drowns their judgement.
Blinds them to the horrors that reside under the dirt.
Today, the children start their day by playing a game.
